With the help of this extension, one can go through any problem to any other problem easily (also can go to a problem from status/submission/hack pages to the desired problem).

You can try this extension.
##### Steps to follow (for the installation)
Right now I haven't deployed/uploaded it on either Chrome or Firefox but you can install it locally!
You just have to clone [this repo](https://github.com/dhanrajchaurasia/CF-Get-Problems) and unpack the folder over the chrome/firefox extension (with developer mode on).

**UPD:** To use this without unpacking the extension just copy-paste [this userscript](https://p.ip.fi/0-SH) in [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or a similar tool.


**UPD2:** Updated the verdict thing as well. You can enter your codeforces handle to make verdict color work!
