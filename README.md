You can try this extension.
##### Steps to follow (for the installation)
Right now I haven't deployed/uploaded it on either Chrome or Firefox but you can install it locally!
You just have to clone [this repo](https://github.com/dhanrajchaurasia/CF-Get-Problems) and unpack the folder over the chrome/firefox extension (with developer mode on).

Happy Coding :)
